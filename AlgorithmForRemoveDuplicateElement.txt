Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers remove the duplicate element

Sample input: [3, 5, 7, 4, 3, 8, 5, 6]
Sample output: [3, 5, 7, 4, 8, 6]

Algorithm:
Step 1: For each element in the given array
            1.1 compare ith element with i+1 to n-1 th element
            1.2 If any of them is equal to ith element then remove it from the array
            1.3 otherwise move to the next element
Step 2 : Return the modified array

3)
A pump can fill the tank in 2 hours
p can fill in 2 hours
l can drain in x hours

actual time to fill the tank is 7/3 hours
in 1 hour 3/7 of the tank is filled

in 1 hour p can fill 1/2 of the tank
in 1 hour l can drain 1/x of the tank

1/2 - 1/x = 3/7
-1/x = 3/7 - 1/2
-1/x = -1/14
x = 14


2) A => 5 hours
   B => 6 hours
   c => empty 12 hours
   1 hour A => 1/5, B => 1/6, c => -1/12
	1 hour toatal => 1/5 + 1/6 - 1/12 => 17/60
	1 hour = 17/60
	x hour = 1
	x = 60/17=> 3 9/17
3) A => 2 hours
   l => x hours(empty)
   total => 2 1/3
   1 hour A=> 1/2, l => -1/x, total => 3/7
	1/2 - 1/x = 3/7

4) A => 37 1/2 minutes
   B => 45 minutes
	1 minute A => 2/75, B => 1/45
	1 minute total => A + B
	30 minute total => 30A + 30B
	B is turned off after x minutes
	30A + xB = 1
	XB	= 1 - 60/75 => 1 - 4/5 => 1/5
	XB = 1/5
	X * 1 / 45 = 1/5
	x / 45 = 1/5
	x = 1 / 5 * 45
	x = 9
